# PA-037: Self-Evolving Architecture Implementation

**Goal:** Transition Silhouette to a dynamic, self-managing multi-agent system.

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Dynamic Registry)
The first step is to treat agents as data, not code.
1.  **Create `data/agents/definitions`**: A folder to store individual agent JSONs.
2.  **Create `services/registry/AgentRegistry.ts`**:
    *   Methods: `loadAll()`, `saveAgent(profile)`, `getAgent(id)`.
    *   This will replace the reliance on `INITIAL_AGENTS` constant.

## Phase 2: The Architect (Meta-Agent)
Once agents are data, we need an agent to manage that data.
1.  **Define `ArchitectProfile` in `services/agents/Architect.ts`**.
2.  **Capabilities**:
    *   `create_agent_profile`: Generates a valid JSON definition.
    *   `register_squad`: Groups agents into a team.
    *   `assign_task_to_squad`: Route high-level goals.

## Phase 3: The Supervisor (Quality Control)
1.  **Define `SupervisorProfile`**.
2.  **Capabilities**:
    *   `review_interaction_logs`: Analyze `SystemBus` traffic.
    *   `flag_underperformance`: Detect cognitive failures.

## Execution Strategy
We will start by building the **Registry** (Phase 1) as it is the dependency for everything else.
