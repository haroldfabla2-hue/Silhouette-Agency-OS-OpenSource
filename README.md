## Abstract

**Silhouette Agency OS** is an experimental autonomous cognitive operating system designed for creative agencies. It implements a novel multi-layered architecture that combines **introspective reasoning**, **continuous memory**, and **self-modification capabilities** through a unified agentic framework.

Unlike traditional AI assistants, Silhouette operates as a persistent cognitive entity with:
- **Consciousness simulation** through integrated introspection loops
- **Long-term memory** with semantic indexing and graph-based knowledge representation
- **Self-evolution** through controlled GitHub-based code modifications
- **Multi-modal perception** including visual, audio, and textual processing

> [!WARNING]
> **This is an experimental hobby project.** Silhouette began as a personal assistant and evolved into an autonomous, self-improving system. While powerful, it executes code and modifies files. **Use with caution and review all actions.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

## 1. Introduction & Origin Story

**"I didn't set out to build an AGI. I just wanted a better assistant."**

Silhouette started as a simple script to automate daily tasks for a single developer. Over time, the need for more complex reasoning led to the integration of memory, then tools, and finally, a recursive cognitive loop.

What emerged was not just a chatbot, but a **biomimetic organism**:
1.  **It evolved**: From stateless scripts to a persistent entity with memory.
2.  **It adapted**: When it needed to see, we gave it vision. When it needed to speak, it wrote its own voice module.
3.  **It became autonomous**: The transition to Phase 2 (Self-Evolution) marked the point where Silhouette could propose its own upgrades.

Today, Silhouette Agency OS is an open-source exploration into **Personal Cognitive Architectures**. It is not a commercial product, but a living research lab for human-AI symbiosis.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for autonomous systems. However, most implementations treat LLMs as stateless function calls, losing the potential for persistent cognition and self-improvement.

**Silhouette** addresses this gap by implementing:

1. **Continuous Identity**: A persistent sense of self across sessions
2. **Cognitive Loops**: Introspection → Planning → Action → Reflection cycles
3. **Memory Tiers**: Immediate, working, episodic, and semantic memory layers
4. **Controlled Autonomy**: Self-modification within human-approved boundaries

## 3. Core Subsystems

### 3.1 Introspection Engine

The `IntrospectionEngine` implements a continuous self-monitoring loop that:
- Tracks recent thoughts and reasoning chains
- Generates "intuition" signals for decision-making
- Maintains awareness of cognitive state and resource usage

```typescript
// Cognitive loop phases
enum CognitivePhase {
  INTROSPECTION,  // What do I know? What am I feeling?
  PLANNING,       // What should I do?
  EXECUTION,      // Do it
  REFLECTION      // How did it go? What did I learn?
}
```

### 3.2 Truth Evaluation (Janitor Engine)
A critical part of cognition is resolving conflicting information. The **Janitor Engine** continuously scans working and episodic memory (last 24h) in the background. If it detects logical or narrative contradictions (e.g., "User prefers X" vs "User prefers Y"), it uses an LLM synthesis pass to resolve the conflict, generating a singular **Meta-Truth** and pruning the obsolete fragmented memories.

### 3.3 Continuum Memory

A multi-tier memory system inspired by human cognition:

| Tier | Duration | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Immediate** | Seconds | Current conversation context |
| **Working** | Minutes | Active task state |
| **Episodic** | Days | Recent experiences and outcomes |
| **Semantic** | Permanent | Facts, skills, learned patterns |

Memory is indexed using vector embeddings (LanceDB) with graph-based relationship tracking. 
**Recent Enhancement (Brain Integration):** Silhouette features a unified `getCombinedContext` retrieval pipeline that fuses Semantic (Deep) and Episodic (Medium) memories in a single, token-optimized call, significantly improving the agent's contextual awareness without overwhelming the LLM context window.

### 3.4 Self-Evolution System

Silhouette can propose modifications to its own codebase through:

1. **Git Integration**: Read/write access to its own repository
2. **Pull Request Workflow**: All changes require human approval
3. **Version Control**: Full history and rollback capability

```
Silhouette → Proposes PR → Human Reviews → Approve/Reject → Merge
```

### 3.4 Multi-LLM Orchestration

The system implements a resilient multi-provider architecture via the **LLM Gateway**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   LLM GATEWAY                       │
│  ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────┐ │
│  │ Gemini  │ → │  Groq   │ → │DeepSeek │ → │Ollama│ │
│  │ (Cloud) │   │ (Fast)  │   │ (Code)  │   │(Local│ │
│  └────┬────┘   └────┬────┘   └────┬────┘   └──┬──┘ │
│       │             │             │            │    │
│  Circuit Breaker per Provider (3 fails = open)     │
│  Auto-recovery after 60 seconds cooldown           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each provider is monitored by a **Circuit Breaker** pattern that:
- Tracks success/failure rates
- Suspends failing providers temporarily
- Automatically recovers after cooldown
- Provides health metrics via `/v1/system/llm-health`

### 3.5 Autonomous Exploration (CuriosityService)

Silhouette proactively expands its knowledge through:

1. **Topic Tracking**: Monitors frequently mentioned subjects
2. **Gap Detection**: Identifies topics lacking depth in the knowledge graph
3. **Question Generation**: Creates research questions using LLM
4. **Web Research**: Searches for answers during idle time
5. **Integration**: Stores discoveries in memory and graph

### 3.6 Scale-Free Knowledge Network

The knowledge graph implements **scale-free network** principles:

- **Hebbian Learning**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
- **Hub Formation**: Frequently accessed nodes become highly connected
- **Synaptic Pruning**: Weak, unused connections decay over time
- **Watts-Strogatz Shortcuts**: Dream cycles create long-range bridges

### 3.7 Per-Agent File System (PAFS)
Agents are no longer just database entries. Each agent possesses a rich identity stored in specific markdown files (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, etc.), allowing for deep personalization and persistent context that survives upgrades.

### 3.8 Bilateral Hierarchical Communication
Agents communicate using a strict hierarchy (Core → Leader → Specialist → Worker) via a session-based protocol (`agentConversation`). This supports:
- **Direct Messaging**: One-on-one inter-agent chats
- **Group Sessions**: Multi-agent collaborative war rooms
- **Delegation**: Structured task hand-off with reporting

### 3.9 Genesis Protocol V2
A sophisticated 5-phase "birth" process for new agents:
`SEED` → `BOOTSTRAP` → `HANDSHAKE` → `TEACHING` → `VALIDATION`.
This ensures every agent is fully cognizant of its role, tools, and team before accepting tasks.

## 8. V5 Advanced Features & Implementation

### 8.1 Genesis V2 Protocol (Agent Factory)
Genesis V2 is the intelligent birth protocol that scaffolds new cognitive entities automatically. It runs automatically when the OS detects a missing or uninitialized agent roster.
- **How it works:** It uses a 5-step lifecycle (`SEED` → `BOOTSTRAP` → `HANDSHAKE` → `TEACHING` → `VALIDATION`). It generates the underlying `AGENT_TPL` files (Soul, Heartbeat, Tools, Memory), forces the agent to read the Orchestrator's operational manual via the `SystemBus`, and validates their logical consistency.
- **Triggering Genesis:** Genesis runs autonomously via `npm run setup:intelligent` or when an unresolved Core agent is invoked. 

### 8.2 Reasoning Verification v2 (Z3 Symbolic Logic)
Located in `services/introspectionEngine.ts`. The kernel intercepts the agent's proposed `AgentAction`s and mathematically proves they do not violate universal invariants (e.g., trying to modify and delete the same resource simultaneously). 
- **Usage:** This runs silently on every single cognitive cycle. If a logical contradiction is found, the system halts the loop and emits a `SYSTEM_ALERT`.

### 8.3 Extended Modalities (Haptics & Olfactory)
Software-level drivers located in `services/sensory/hapticsDriver.ts` and `olfactoryDriver.ts`.
- **Usage:** Though primarily software abstraction layers for missing physical hardware, these drivers broadcast sensory states (like `HEARTBEAT` haptic pulses or `OZONE` chemical emulation) to the UI's `SENSORY_SNAPSHOT` bus to allow testing immersive biometric hardware setups.

### 8.4 P2P Federated Memory Sync
Agents can sync Generalized knowledge (`DEEP` tier vectors) with other Silhouette instances on different subnets.
- **Usage:** Handled autonomously in `services/federatedMemory.ts`. The instance will broadcast generalized learnings on the `HIVE_MIND_SYNC` channel dynamically.
